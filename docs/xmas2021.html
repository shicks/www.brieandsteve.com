<h1>Christmas Greetings 2021</h1>

<p>2021 was a year of new beginnings for the Hicks clan.  Our big news is that we (somewhat unexpectedly) took a leap of faith and moved across the country.  We found and bought a house sight-unseen, packed up our wonderful Sunnyvale home (with plenty of help from friends and family), threw a “drive-thru” masked going away party, and made our escape to Virginia.  Our new place has been great, though we’re still settling in.</p>

<p>Fortunately, with most of the world still on lockdown, neither of our jobs were negatively impacted by the move: Steve was promoted to Staff Software Engineer at Google this spring, and has been approved for permanent remote work (which was quite a relief).  Brianna still works part time at Cornerstone Research and enjoys managing.</p>

<p>After over a year in seclusion, the children finally got out!  Christopher and Una both attended Vacation Bible School (in-person!) this summer and now participate in Awana (Christopher as a Spark and Una as a Cubbie).  Christopher started (homeschool) Kindergarten and is involved in Classical Conversations and a weekly academy program where he is making friends and learning a lot.  Una started a fabulous preschool program and is thriving in it.  Emily continues to be a joy, has shown that she can hold her own in this family, and is constantly trying to keep up with her siblings.</p>

<p>We enjoyed some wonderful family visits this year.  We hiked in the Smoky Mountains with Steve's family and in Shenandoah National Park with Brie's family.  Living closer to family has been a huge blessing.</p>

<p>We are thankful for our friends (new and old) and family who have supported us.  We enjoyed video conference and in-person catch-ups throughout the year, and look forward to hosting more of you in our new home the next time you are in the Northern Virginia/DC Area (or “the DMV” as the locals call it).</p>

<p class="benediction">May the peace and comfort of Jesus Christ be with you now and throughout 2022, whatever it may bring!</p>
